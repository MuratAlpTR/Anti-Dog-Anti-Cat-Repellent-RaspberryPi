			###	Dog or Cat? (If you‚Äôre afraid of dogs and cats)	###

Project Name: ‚Äú Dog-Cat-Repeller.py ‚Äù

To create an Raspberry Pi Dog and Cat repellent, you‚Äôll need some basic components. Here are the parts you can use for this project:

Raspberry Pi Board: Choose a Raspberry Pi 3 or Raspberry Pi 4. This board allows you to communicate with sensors.

Ultrasonic Sensor: Use an ultrasonic sensor to detect the approach of animals. This sensor measures the distance and determines how close the animals are.

Buzzer (Audible Alert): Use a buzzer to provide an audible warning when animals approach.

Breadboard and Jumper Cables: Use a breadboard and jumper cables to prototype your circuit.

Power Supply: You‚Äôll need a power supply to run the Raspberry Pi.

9V Alkaline Battery Part Name: [‚Äî Arduino 9V Battery Power Cable ‚Äî]


Enclosure or Case: Select a box or case to house and protect all the components.
[‚Äî For 3D design, there are various tools and software available. You can create your enclosure design using tools like Blender, Tinkercad, or Fusion 360 and then 3D print it. Good luck! ‚Äî]
Feel free to customize this project according to your needs. Remember to approach this project ethically and without causing harm to animals. üêæ

## Attention read ## 
This code detects the approach of animals using an ultrasonic sensor for distance measurement and provides a warning using a buzzer. Additionally, when the dog or cat buttons are pressed, it prints the corresponding messages to the serial monitor. Make sure to correctly connect the trig and echo pins of the sensor. You can customize the code according to your needs

Attention: Please do not use this device to harm humans or animals. Use it only to repel animals.
